# Problem Statement

# Input N = number of Cows
# List [Hi] = upper bound of hunger of each cow i
# Output : number of ways to construct [hi] such that 0 <= hi <= Hi and
# if we feed cows in consecutive pairs, each feed will reduce hi and hi+1 by 1
# there exists a constant D such that all cows
# hunger level can reach to D after feeding in pairs in certain times.
